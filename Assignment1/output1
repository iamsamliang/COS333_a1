Title: Special Topics in Public Education Reform

Description: Examines historical and contemporary approaches to
education reform in America's cities, with a particular focus on how
reform efforts have affected students. We will explore the following
questions: What are the historical challenges of urban education reform
and how have policymakers attempted to address them? What can we learn
from urban districts that are attempting to combat these problems today,
and what are the "best practices" in urban education reform? This course
will investigate both the administrative and scholastic levels of
reform, as well as the environmental factors that affect the lives of
urban students.
