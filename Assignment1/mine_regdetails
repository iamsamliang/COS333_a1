Title: Music from the Hispanophone Caribbean

Description: This interdisciplinary seminar utilizes the musical
cultures of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba to reflect
upon the aesthetic, migratory, and social histories of the Hispanophone
Caribbean.  Students will listen to the sounded legacies of conquest,
slavery, colonialism, and U.S. intervention and occupation. The effects
of transnational migration on music's performance and reception will
also be one of the key themes in the course.  We will not only consider
the creative traditions and receptive worlds embedded in musical
recordings, but will also pay attention to music's traces in literature,
film, and other ephemera.

Title: Model Memoirs:  The Life Stories of International Fashion Models

Description: Explores the life-writing of American, African, and Asian
women in the fashion industry as a launching point for thinking about
race, gender, and class. How do ethnicity and femininity intersect? How
are authenticity and difference commodified? How do women construct
identities through narrative and negotiate their relationships to their
bodies, families, and nations? This course will include guest lectures
by fashion editors and models; discussions of contemporary television
programs, global fashion, and cultural studies; and student self-
narratives about their relationships with cultural standards of beauty,
whether vexed or not.

Title: The Black Melting Pot: Interrogating Race, Difference, and
Identity

Description: As the demographics of Blacks in America change, we are
compelled to rethink the dominant stories of who African Americans are,
and from whence they come. In this seminar, we will explore the deep
cultural, genealogical, national origin, regional, and class-based
diversity of people of African descent in the United States. Materials
for the course will include scholarly writings as well as memoirs and
fiction. In addition to reading assignments, students will be expected
to complete an ethnographic or oral history project based upon research
conducted within a Black community in the U.S., and a music or visual
art based presentation of work.

Title: Josephine Baker and the Modern

Description: What does a black burlesque star have to do with the making
of Euro-American modernity? This course situates the performance art of
Josephine Baker as a dynamic fulcrum through which to trace the
unexpected connections between the invention of what might be called a
"modernist style" and the staging of black skin at the turn of the 20th
century.  We will study her work in film, photography, and cinema as an
active and profound engagement with a range of modernist innovations and
theories in the fields of film, photography, architecture, art, and
literature.

20th century emphasizing the relationship between cultural production
and historical phenomenon.  What is the relationship between African
American cultural production and historical phenomena like the Great
Migration and key cultural movements like the Harlem Renaissance in
American life?  Additionally, how do we place African American
literature and cultural production in a global narrative that
encompasses decolonization, multiculturalism and globalization?  Primary
texts include novels, short stories, some poetry and video and
performance art.

Title: Race, Drugs, and Drug Policy in America

Description: From "Chinese opium" to Oxycontin, and from cocaine and
"Crack" to BiDil, drug controversies reflect enduring debates about the
role of medicine, the law, the policing of ethnic identity, and racial
difference. This course explores the history of controversial substances
(prescription medicines, over-the-counter products, black market
substances, psychoactive drugs), and how, from cigarettes to alcohol and
opium, these substances become vehicles for heated debates over
immigration, identity, cultural and biological difference, criminal
character, the line between legality and illegality, and the boundaries
of the normal and the pathological.

Title: Topics in African American Religion: Black Religion and Black
Political Thought

Description: Scholars of the African America experience have located the
black church as the cultural, social, and political womb of the black
community.  This research tends to think of the church as a structure
that brings actors into contact with one another; it has paid less
attention to the church as a place that brings actors into contact with
ideas.  This course will use a variety of classic and contemporary texts
about black political thought as an entry into investigating the
connections between black religious ideas and political activism. The
class links the work on religion to an intensive introduction to black
political thought.

Title: Postblack - Contemporary African American Art

Description: As articulated by Thelma Golden, postblack refers to the
work of African American artists who emerged in the 1990s with
ambitious, irreverent, and sassy work. Though hard to define, postblack
suggested the emergence of a generation of artists removed from the long
tradition of black affirmation of the Harlem Renaissance, black
empowerment of the Black Arts movement, and identity politics of the
1980s and early 90s. This seminar provides an opportunity for a deep
engagement with the work of African American artists of the past decade.
It will involve critical and theoretical readings on multiculturalism,
race, identity, and contemporary art.

Title: Local Governance and Development in Africa

Description: Decentralization is widely advocated as a means of
enhancing the quality of governance, improving the quality of service
delivery, and achieving a variety of related socio-economic development
objectives. However, reforms across Africa have often failed to achieve
the desired objectives. The course seeks to explain this paradox and to
explore the multiple forms of local governance in Africa. We will
analyze empirical examples from across the African continent as well as
case studies from other regions for comparative perspective, to assess
the potential of decentralization reforms and community-driven
development projects to improve outcomes.

Africa's character prior to modern nationhood forms the backdrop to
discussions of the development and utilization of social, political, and
economic strategies for continued participation in global political and
economic intercourse. Themes include: traditional religious practice and
the church; global economic interactions; African interstate relations;
governance, regime change, and elections; wars and displacement; and
women in society.

Title: Special Topics in Public Education Reform

Description: Examines historical and contemporary approaches to
education reform in America's cities, with a particular focus on how
reform efforts have affected students. We will explore the following
questions: What are the historical challenges of urban education reform
and how have policymakers attempted to address them? What can we learn
from urban districts that are attempting to combat these problems today,
and what are the "best practices" in urban education reform? This course
will investigate both the administrative and scholastic levels of
reform, as well as the environmental factors that affect the lives of
urban students.

Title: Uncreative Writing

Description: Long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack,
eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and digital
replication.  How does writing respond to this new environment?  This
workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of
appropriation, replication, plagiarism, privacy, sampling, plundering,
as compositional methods.  Along the way, we'll trace the rich history
of forgery, frauds, hoaxes, avatars, and impersonations spanning the
arts, with a particular emphasis on how they employ language.

Title: Suburban Nation:  The Rise and Sprawl of Modern American Suburbia

Description: This seminar will explore the many meanings of suburbia in
modern American history.  First, we will examine the onset of the urban
crisis and the attendant rise of suburbia as an attractive alternative
for many people. We will then focus on the ways in which the movement to
suburbs intersected with the civil rights movement.   Finally, we will
examine how a diverse array of social and political movements of the
postwar era -- from liberal causes like feminism and environmentalism to
the mobilization of modern conservatism -- sprang from suburbia.

Title: Moby-Dick Unbound

Description: This seminar undertakes a close reading of  <u>Moby-
Dick</u> (1851), often acclaimed as the greatest American novel. Why was
this story of a tragic sea voyage so neglected in its day, and so
celebrated by later generations? To explore its twin lines of action--
Ahab's drive to kill a white whale versus Ishmael's quest to know it--we
use the methods of history, literature, art, religion, economics,
philosophy, and ecology. Of special interest are the ways Melville
anticipates recent environmental thought, depicts a globalized culture,
and dramatizes the national struggle to reconcile faith and fact, race
and justice.

Prerequisites: Applications are available outside the American Studies
Program office, 42 McCosh Hall, and on the AMS website:

Title: At Home in New Jersey

Description: This team-taught seminar is designed as a capstone course
for AMS concentrators and offers an opportunity to work at a more
sophisticated and advanced level. Taking New Jersey as our object of
study, we will reflect on the ways various residents (and visitors) have
constructed worlds--spatial worlds as well as worlds of meaning--in and
on this particular ground.  We will examine both how we live today and
the multiple ways that "how we live today" must be situated within
longer histories, including such topics as property rights,
suburbanization, zoning, transportation, home and homelessness,
immigration, environment and community.

Title: Anthropology of Mental Illness

Description: We adopt a comparative, historical, and cultural approach
to mental health, and its accompanying illnesses, remedies, and
institutions. Especially important will be the creation of cultural
consensus surrounding categories of normal and pathological in mental
health, and their subsequent codification in diagnoses, treatments, and
institutions. We'll examine psychoanalytic theory, American psychiatry,
and debates that call the very premise of disordered health and
"madness" into question. We'll also focus on ethnographic accounts of
mental illnesses: depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and the global
rise of pharmaceuticals treatments.

communities and societies. Throughout the survey of discourses and
practices by and about the so-called "islamists," their supporters and
their opponents, the course will center on the reconfiguration of
religion, self, community, culture, society, identity, and power.
Emphasis will be on the Arab world and Iran.

Title: Anthropology of Human Rights: Culture, Violence, and Difference

Description: This course examines the impact of anthropology on human
rights. While human rights policy upholds universal norms and standards,
anthropology examines the range of human cultural diversity and
experience. We explore what the study of this diversity contributes to
the understanding of human rights issues, including ethnic cleansing,
gender-based violence, and torture.  Additional themes address how
understandings of cultural diversity affect central questions for human
rights policy and anthropology, including justice, the body, and
citizenship. Case studies include Bosnia, Rwanda, South Africa,
Argentina, and Guatemala.

technologies from which they resonate, and tours their cultural
surroundings. We analyze acoustics of ritual, everyday life, social
identities, and nature, for example, and relate the auditory to the
visual and textual. How do voices, radio, cinema, concerts, phonographs,
MP3s, world music, and recording studios mediate culture? How is sound a
"thing" that can be contemplated, packaged, or sold? What is at stake in
debates about digital vs. analogue, liveness, fidelity, and intellectual
property? Projects will explore possibilities for portraying
ethnographic knowledge with sound media.

and Cyprus

Description: Explores the constitution of the body politic in Greece and
Cyprus, from the end of the Ottoman Empire to the ongoing formation of
the European Union. Through ethnographies and films, we will trace
conflict and conciliation between Greek and Turkish peoples, focusing on
two historical case studies: the Asia Minor Catastrophe of the 1920s,
and the invasion of Cyprus in the 1970s. Topics will include: statehood,
nationalism, and empire; war and peace-making; violence and health;
migration and patriation; gender, community, and identity; social trauma
and generational transmission; archival and bodily memory; and the
modern uses of history.

Prerequisites: At least one course in Hellenic Studies and/or a course

Title: The Uses of Deception: Perspectives on Magic and Science

Description: "Deception" usually has negative connotations, but
scientists and magicians use it in service of truth, justice, and
entertainment. For a magician's trick to induce doubt and delight, an
audience's attention must be misdirected. Likewise, biomedicine and many
other fields use deception (e.g., the placebo) as a research tool.
Topics include: the 'real' as objective truth or cultural construct;
social fictions in daily life; the tangled histories and present day
alliance of science and magic; fraudulent vs. legitimate deception;
popular access to science. Guest magicians may visit; research projects
may involve fieldwork and multimedia.

Prerequisites: This seminar approaches the uses of deception
anthropologically, as culturally meaningful practices. Participants must
have at least one prior course in anthropology and/or history of science
and/or a field that customarily employs misdirection as a research
technique, or instructor's permission. Students with prior training in
ethnographic methods (or other relevant experience) are welcome to
design field research projects.

Description: Foodways is a biocultural exploration of human food
consumption. Readings and discussions will focus on both the biological
and socio-cultural aspects of what humans eat and the ways human
cultures conceptualize food and its consumption. Topics include the
nutritional needs of humans, the differences between diet and cuisine,
which foods taste good and why some foods taste disgusting, the
evolution of human diet, how cultures define what is and what is not
food, the symbolism associated with various kinds of food, and how
cultures distinguish foods that are suitable for some members of the

Title: History of Anthropological Theory

Description: This course is an introduction to fundamental theories and
debates in social/cultural anthropology. We will examine the national
and colonial origins of anthropology, considering how western encounters
with non-western peoples in the 19th-20th centuries opened questions
about human kinship, history, economy, religion, language, sexuality,
and personhood that continue to shape the horizons of our thought today.
We will study this inheritance critically, exploring the changing
concepts, methods, and ethics of anthropological research and writing,
and evaluate their bearing on questions of power, justice, and identity
in the present.

Description: From Brazilian capoeira, Japanese dance, and American jazz
piano, to glassblowing, lawyering, and navigating a warship: how do
people acquire the skills necessary to perform expert activities in
different cultural settings? What kinds of knowledge can anthropologists
gain as apprentices, and how does it translate into writing? This course
focuses on apprenticeship as a subject and method for anthropological
research. We examine theories of learning and their application to case
studies of wide-ranging domains of expertise. Students conduct
ethnographic and experiential activities, generating original data for
discussion and analysis.

Prerequisites: Students should have background in anthropology or other
social sciences.

Description: Introduces a key area of research in anthropology: the
study of kinship--the ways in which peoples of different cultures marry
and relate within and outside the family and the means by which one
generation relates to one another within/outside the family. Course
opens with a discussion of what kinship means to the social
anthropologist as distinct from the biologist, and considers different
possible approaches of the subject within social anthropology itself.
Course also examines how recent work on gender, person and the body have
challenged and modified earlier assumptions about descent, succession,
marriage and familial alliances.

Title: Theories of Housing and Urbanism

Description: The seminar will explore theories of urbanism and housing
by reading canonical writers who have created distinctive and
influential ideas about urbanism and housing from the nineteenth century
to the present. The writers are architects, planners, and social
scientists. The theories are interdisciplinary. One or two major work
will be discussed each week. We will critically evaluate their relevance
and significance for architecture now. Topics include: modernism,
functionalism and social change; technological futurism; social
critiques of urban design, the New Urbanism; the networked city; and

Title: Topics in the History and Theory of Architecture

Description: We will consider that a successful thesis entails the
meeting of a socio-cultural problematic with a specific disciplinary
issue, that the confluence and exchange between these external and
internal situations can instigate an original contribution to
architectural knowledge and technique.  The "newness" of this
contribution comes through a particular kind of repetition, a wily
swerve within the established canon.  The seminar will introduce
disciplinary methods and themes through close readings of architectural
texts and objects and will provide a workshop for the testing and
elaboration of architectural polemics through directed research.

Title: Survey of Selected Works of Twentieth-Century Architects

Description: This course is intended to expose the students to a range
of major works, built and unbuilt, of architecture from 1950 to the
present. This course will  focus on these particular buildings as they
open themselves to a textual analysis. These analyses are intended to
open up issues such as criticality, autonomy and singularity as they
begin to evolve in architectural building (as opposed to texts) in the
last half of the 20th century. This course will concentrate on
individual buildings not architects. Each analysis will be accompanied
by an illustrated presentation and selected readings.

Urbanism

Description: The American city has undergone a number of restructurings
since colonial times. However, the mutations that occurred at the
beginning and in the middle of the twentieth century not only
restructured the city but also dramatically changed its configuration in
a radical way.  We might be living a similar situation today at the
beginning of a new century, when changes as powerful as the sub-
urbanization of the 1950's are generating new configurations of urban
space and form that are expanding once more the definition of the city
and urban culture.

Title: Topics in Contemporary Architecture & Urbanism: Politics of the
Building Envelope

Description: Seminar explores the building envelope as the intersection
between environmental, iconographic and territorial concerns.  As the
limit between inside/outside, natural/artificial, private/public, the
building envelope is a key political subject. By analyzing the building
envelope, the course identifies a ground on which to re-empower the
discipline as a transformative force in the reorganization of the
contemporary ecologies of power.

Title: Advanced Topics in Modern Architecture: Modernist Dilemmas:
Brasilia and Chandigarh turn 50

Description: During the twentieth century, several new capitals were
built from scratch, for economic and political reasons. Two of these -
Brasilia and Chandigarh -- share several traits, partly due to the
impact of Le Corbusier.  The full force of modern architecture was put
to the test. This seminar will reassess these two capitals which are
turning 50, studying the original project from different and often
conflicting perspectives. Particular attention will be paid to the role
of popular and professional media in the global promotion and
circulation of the new cities.

Title: Topics in Contemporary Architectural Theory: Kissing Architecture

Description: Course explores and solicits contact between architecture
and other types of visual practice, argues that architecture has
consistently propelled itself through its embrace of other cultural
forms, and  examines how most key moments in the advancement of 20th
century architecture are related to the conceptual and material friction
generated by contact between architecture and other mediums.  Course
constructs a genealogy for contemporary architecture by examining the
history and theory of medium specificity, tracing the dissolution of
material specificity into notions of discipline.

Title: Material Ecologies

Description: Buckminster Fuller once noted that the problem of
diminishing global resources & the energy crisis was not one of
fundamental lack but one of ignorance, failure of imagination &
inability to use resources intelligently. Architecture consumes
resources, demands expenditure of vast sums of money, is undeniably
involved in the global exchange of energy & capital & the global
distribution of material. Inevitably architecture is implicated in the
social & environmental effects produced by these systems of exchange.
How do architects situate themselves within this ecological need? What
impact does it have on architecture as a material practice?

Title: Topics in Architecture and Information

Description: Geometry has dominated design representation and
computational models for years. Many of the challenges related to the
need to reduce the use of resources require novel models for
computational design, reaching beyond geometry only. Scientific data
visualization has progressed using computation for capturing complex
phenomena in visual form. Architecture faces almost the reverse problem
in shaping complex process through design. This advanced seminar will
challenge the participants to develop novel design models in a
computational design context.

Description: This course has two aims, close encounters with some of the
world's major traditions of ornament (ancient Mediterranean, European,
Chinese, Islamic, and others) and close examination of some of the
issues that arise in the study of ornament and its history. One
troublesome issue is simply the problem of defining "ornament" (or
"decoration"): is this anything besides a catch-all category for arts
traditionally excluded from "the fine arts"? Other topics to be
discussed are the relations between ornament and architecture, and
between ornament and representation; plant, animal, and geometrical
ornament; and ornamental systems.

Title: Seminar in Modern Art: The Origins of Abstraction

Description: Taught in collaboration with Leah Dickerman, curator of
painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, this seminar will
contribute to the conception of a major exhibition on abstraction to be
held in 2012. Through close examination of original works and primary
texts, we will investigate the beginnings of nonobjective art in its
various iterations across Europe c. 1910-25. Why abstraction? What were
the various motives and methods of its development? How could different
philosophies and ideologies be projected onto this one form? Why did it
have such repercussive effects across the arts? Regular study visits to
MoMA will be involved.

Title: Princeton Atelier: Accidental Narrative: Dance, Video,
Installation Project

Description: Choreographer Susan Marshall and project designer Jeff Sugg
will collaborate on a new art installation and theatrical performance
event. Rather than use cameras to record and enhance predetermined
movements and scripted events, the artists will capture random actions
with predetermined movements of cameras, thereby creating an "accidental
narrative". Atelier students will create their own short, wordless,
frame-and-figure-focused video works, which will help shape the
direction of the larger project on which they will collaborate with
Marshall and Sugg from start to finish.

Prerequisites: Enrollment by application and interview.  Students with a
strong interest in collaboration and with experience working as
directors, choreographers, filmmakers, video artists, installation
artists, or engineers are encouraged to apply. Students able to devote

of conjugation and the Diels-Alder reaction. After a coverage of
aromaticity and the chemistry of benzene, we then move into the heart of
the course: the nature and reactivity of the carbonyl group, a subject
that is central to both mainstream organic chemistry and biochemistry.
Throughout this course, an effort will be made to demystify the art of
chemical synthesis. This course is appropriate for chemistry majors,
premedical students, and other students with an interest in organic
chemistry and its central position in the life sciences.

Title: Rediscovering the Hebraic Sources of Modern Political Thought

Description: Modern political thought owes more to ancient Hebraic
sources, including the Bible and Talmud, than has been previously
acknowledged. Recent studies tell the story of political Hebraism, the
early modern attempt to glean moral, legal, and political meaning from
Hebraic texts. This is one of the most exciting chapters in the history
of political thought being written today. This course will discuss
Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, and other major theorists of modern natural law
and politics. We will consider how the ancient texts inspired new ideas
of the rule of law, republic, and social justice.

Classical Texts and African-American Writing

Description: This is a course about the complex inspiration African-
American writers took from texts of classical antiquity, and the
challenges they faced to make them their own. We will read and put into
dialogue ancient Greek and Roman works and modern responses, ranging
from the 18th to the 21st century. Themes include Odyssean wandering,
Iliadic rage, satire, patronage, rhetoric, literacy, liberation,
pedagogy, praise poetry, myth, and the canon. The aim is to gain new
appreciation of both sets of texts, and to articulate what happens at
their points of intersection in modern American culture.

Title: Problems in Greek Literature: Hellenistic Poetry

Description: A survey of recent developments in the study of Hellenistic
poetry through consideration of a wide range of authors. Attention
focuses on Callimachus, Apollonius Rhodius and Theocritus, but other
poets, ranging in time from Philetas to Parthenius, will be considered,
including some of the problems involved in working with highly
fragmentary texts. Course  also permits us to look at certain aspects of
the reception of Hellenistic poetry in Roman literature.

Title: Problems in Greek Literature: Heroic Lives and Legends in the
Second Sophistic

Description: Course explores the reanimation of the Greek heroic
tradition in the Imperial era from three intertwined perspectives:
literary, ritual and social. Selections from Dio Chrysostom, Lucian,
Plutarch, Aelius Aristides and Philostratus, are studied.  Attention is
paid to the spirit of arch and learned play for which the Second
Sophistic is famous, and with an eye to how the heroic legacy was
tailored to the needs of Graeco-Roman culture in the spheres of
athletics, performance oratory, civic deportment and spiritual
experience. Coure also delves into the growing body of scholarship on
Imperial-era literature in its cultural context.

Title: Violence and Moving Images: Politics, Aesthetics, Spectatorship

Description: Why has violence in moving images become so prevalent and
graphic since the 1960's and why do we watch it even though most of us
find such violence repugnant in real life?  Looking at a variety of
genres (action, horror, serial killer films, Westerns, war films, etc.)
we will consider the social and political meanings of these films and
their aesthetic effects.  Questions considered will include: How has
violence been used to critically figure the risks, excesses, and
alienation of modern culture?  How has film violence been represented to
elicit terror, excitement, curiosity?  And why has film violence become
so widespread globally.

Title: Coming of Age in Minor Cultures: Eastern European Literature and
Cinema

Description: The cultures of Central-Eastern Europe, living in the
shadow of hegemonic powers, tend to conceptualize themselves as
subaltern, underdeveloped, victimized, immature, minor, un-enlightened
or even backward. Often, this self-understanding is expressed in art
through the analogy of childhood or adolescence; the relation of a minor
culture to a great culture is that of a child to a parental figure. We
will closely examine Polish, Czech, Yugoslavian, Bosnian and Hungarian
works of literature and cinema that explore how -- if at all -- the
development of character is informed by unfavorable geopolitical and
historical determinations.

Title: Men in Tights: 18th-Century Fiction in Film

Description: 18th-century literature may now be less widely read than
that of any other period--yet current film and fiction almost
obsessively revisits it. What does that say about the present--and about
how we understand the 18th century? Why the popularity of such "costume
drama"? How does film, that quintessentially modern medium, reinterpret
or translate the 18th-century novel, and why so often? We'll read
several important 18th-century European novels, some of which have
received more than one film treatment, and examine the films as
"translations" of those novels, and the cultures that produced them,
into 20th and 21st-century visual terms.

Title: Special Topics in Dance History, Criticism, and Aesthetics: Music
and Dance Collaborations in the 20th Century

Description: An interdisciplinary venture between the Department of
Music and the Program in Dance, DAN 321 concerns the interaction between
music choreography in late modern ballet, contemporary dance, and post-
modern dance. To establish a viable context for analysis and
interpretation, the course will be taught chronologically, beginning
with the late collaborations between Igor Stravinsky, George Balanchine,
Aaron Copland , Martha Graham, John Cage and Merce Cunningham, and
extending up through the recent reliance on ambient and natural sound.
The course will address the manner in which both dance and music
represent, challenge, and recode each other.

Title: What is a Good Society? Modern Social Ideals in Japan

Description: Japan, along with other East and Southeast Asian nations,
has reined in market forces and produced wealth by relying on the care
of families, communities, and an emphasis on shared morality and values
--while de-emphasizing individual rights and the tolerance of
difference. The outcome is a cohesive and caring society, but one that
has come with social costs. The course discusses these trade-offs in the
context of contemporary social issues: the family and private life,
efforts to improve society through education, socialization, prenatal
care, and eugenics, and Japanese approaches to medicine and bio-ethical
issues.

Description: This is an interdisciplinary research seminar designed to
contextualize recent intellectual contributions on law, social order,
and deviancy in East Asia.  By drawing on political and social theories
regarding marginalization, state rationality, and the public
construction of justice, we will consider how the historical development
of local prosecutorial and penal cultures reflects the spread of
rationalized state institutions and of political and civil rights, even
as these are shaped by local political demands.  We will also examine
how changing debates about crime and deviancy reinforce or challenge
patterns of power.

Title: Introduction to Microeconomics

Description: This course presents fundamental analyses of the ways that
households choose consumption and work, that incentives drive suppliers
to utilize labor, technology and other inputs to produce goods and
services and that a market economy harmonizes its sectors through the
price system.  Against this backdrop, the roles played by public goods,
environmental impacts, income distribution, monopoly power, taxes,
welfare programs and entrepreneurship are considered.  The differing
perspectives of market participants, public policy and academic
economics are all exercised.

Title: History of Economic Thought

Description: A survey of the history of economics, with an emphasis on
the origins, nature, and course of leading economic ideas. This class
aims to situate economic ideas in their historical context, thus
providing a deeper understanding of economic life and theories of it. We
critically appraise economic texts from Aristotle to 20th century
writers, not solely out of antiquarian interest, but also for their
insights into commercial society's foundational issues: the role of the
state in the economy, the nature of human action and of the social good,
and the social effects of property rights, prices, trade and the other
defining attributes of markets.

Title: Issues in Environmental and Natural Resource Economics

Description: Course  introduces use of economics in understanding both
the sources of and the remedies to environmental and resource allocation
problems. It emphasizes the reoccurrence of economic phenomena like
public goods, externalities, market failure and imperfect information.
Students learn about the design and evaluation of environmental policy
instruments, the political economy of environmental policy, and the
valuation of environmental and natural resource services. These concepts
are illustrated in a variety of applications from domestic pollution of
air, water and land to international issues such as global warming and
sustainable development.

Prerequisites: None.  While this course is directed primarily at juniors
and seniors majoring in economics, the theory and applications presented
in the course will be developed from basic principles and should be
accessible to non-economists.

Description: We will use class lectures, case studies, and handouts to
illustrate theories and evidence useful for making investment decisions.
We will discuss optimal portfolio choice, fixed-income securities,
securities analysis, performance evaluation, and hedge funds.  We
examine asset pricing models (such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM), and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)) that describe how
securities are priced when investors choose their portfolios optimally.
The second topic is on bonds and bond pricing. We then go on to discuss
securities valuation models, evaluation of portfolio performance and,
finally, the hedge fund industry.

use to hold the managers of organized human activity--chiefly
corporations--accountable for the resources entrusted to them. Alerts
students to the judgments and assumptions that regulators and managers
make in that process, even when the managers wish to report honestly.
Explores the methods that the managers of resources can (and often do)
use to lie about their actual performance. To become sophisticated
users, not producers, of financial statements, students must master some
record keeping procedures and vocabulary in order to exercise proper
oversight of managerial behavior.

Title: Down the Garden Path

Description: Before the naked city and joyless streets was the garden.
This is its plot. Originally it was a "pleasant place," beyond which, in
space and time, sprouted thorn and thistle. Later, much later, perhaps
when it was already too late, came landscape (is it a noun or a verb, or
both?). This course traces a serpentine path through the history of
landscape, with occasional and revealing vistas to and from literature,
the arts, and the sciences. "Down the Garden Path" suggests being taken
in, willingly falling prey to the ruses that await us in the garden, and
which are masked by its pleasures.

Title: Topics in Animal Behavior: Developmental Systems and Evolution

Description: An examination of Developmental Systems Theory, a
conceptual framework that seeks to replace dichotomous accounts (nature-
nurture, genes-environment, biology-culture) of organismal development.
Major ideas for study include: 1) every trait is produced by the
interaction of many developmental resources; 2) the significance of any
one developmental resource is contingent upon the rest of the developing
system; 3) an organism inherits a wide range of resources that interact
to construct that organism's life cycle; and 4) evolution is not a
matter of organisms being molded by environment, but of organism-
environment systems changing over time.

Description: Beginning with some of Chaucer's short poems, we will
examine the linguistic and intellectual backgrounds of Chaucer's great
(unfinished) masterwork,<u>The Canterbury Tales</u>.  We will situate
individual tales against medieval English and Continental writing and
the Classics, but will primarily be interested in the kinds of noise
that emerge in and between the tales: allusion, politics, insurrection,
devotion, music, echo, repetition, contest, and requital. We'll start by
learning how to convert silent Middle English text into spoken words,
and move on to the larger question of how silence itself is figured in
and against Chaucer's poetry.

reading. We'll consider such topics as the nature of Shakespearean
subjectivity; erotic politics; time as destroyer and time as redeemer;
Shakespearean poetics; Shakespeare in his time and in ours.

Title: Literature of the Fin de Siecle

Description: This course will study the literature of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (1880-1914), revising the
common assumption that experimental modernism was twentieth century
phenomenon or a break with "Victorian" traditions.  We will be concerned
especially with how texts in this period embody and illuminate various
crises (linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual, ethnic) and how
broader socio-cultural movements inspired writers to impose, question,
or experiment with ideas of form and order.

Title: Children's Literature

Description: A survey of classic texts written for children from the
past 200 years in (primarily) England and America. We will examine the
development and range of the genre from early alphabet books to recent
young adult fiction. We will try to put ourselves in the position of
young readers while also studying the works as adult interpreters,
asking such question as: How do stories written for children reflect and
shape the lives of their readers? What can children's literature tell us
about the history of reading, or of growing up, or of the imagination
itself? In the process we will consider psychological and social
questions as well as literary ones.

Title: Faith and Form: Religion and Poetry in the 19th Century

Description: In his 1880 essay "The Study of Poetry," Matthew Arnold
famously proclaimed "[m]ore and more mankind will discover that we have
to turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain
us. Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete, and most of what
now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by
poetry." This course will ask how "poetry," both broadly and
specifically conceived, succeeded and failed in this charge in the
nineteenth century. What do poetry and religion borrow from one another?
How does the history of the two together help us to understand the fate
of each in the twentieth century?

Title: Topics in Drama: The Curious Aesthetics of Musical Theatre

Description: This course will look at the phenomenon of musical theatre,
analyzing musicals as both texts and performances. We will use a variety
of critical methods to address a number of related questions, including:
how do musicals work on audiences? What kinds of cultural work do
musicals do? How can we account for the current resurgence in movie
musicals? What about the experience and form of musical theatre, the
friction or fusion of song, dance, and script, makes it enduringly
popular?

Description: How do we create our artworks, and how do we create
ourselves, in the contemporary world? What can each process tell us
about the other? How do changing notions of subjectivity and subjecthood
interact with our archive of literary and cinematic forms? In this
course we'll explore the technological, geopolitical, and cultural
developments of the last quarter-century through the lenses provided by
novels and films produced in this period. These texts will range from
relatively mainstream to quite experimental; our task, in all cases,
will be to embrace their challenges as well as their pleasures--and,
again, to ask how these inform one another.

Title: Topics in American Literature: American Colonialisms

Description: Amazons and alligators, cannibals and castaways, Utopians
and men with feet for heads, Pequots and Praying Indians, canoes and
tobacco: such people and objects were introduced to Europeans through
fantastically plausible, (un)believable depictions in travel literature,
short fiction, drama, captivity narratives, missionary and promotional
tracts, engravings, and ethnographies.  This course will consider the
diverse meanings and uses they possess in early modern texts written and
read on both sides of the Atlantic. We will also examine modern
representations of these colonial encounters in fiction and film.

Title: Contemporary Literary Theory

Description: Survey of central debates in cultural and literary studies
focusing on texts in contemporary theory that formulate an understanding
of the self.  Course follows shifts between structuralism,
poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, and Marxism.  As we begin to
disentangle the meanings of what we mean when we say "I", we will
inevitably analyze the relationships between subject and subjection,
ideology and power, language and authorship, theory and politics.  We
will ground our analyses within particular literary, visual, and
theoretical works, learning how to read cultural production as theory,
rather than "applying" theory to selected texts.

Description: This course examines how contemporary writers engage with
the most challenging moral issues of our time, including the problem of
freedom in an age of terror, social suffering, and the ethics of
identity.  What rights do individuals have in an age of terrorism?  How
do the constraints of justice affect the nature and meaning of freedom?
How do individuals maintain personal relationships across religious,
racial, or national boundaries?  The course will focus on how major
world writers confront both the questions raised by the politics of
terror and more enduring issues of authenticity, sincerity,
truthfulness, and forgiveness.

figures--those "other" to (often arbitrary) cultural norms--sometimes
tapping into secret selves within those norms?  This course will explore
this question across the "long 19th century," an era in which social and
political ferment confronted British citizens with a world of others: in
behavior, gender, race, class, and physical appearance.

frontiers of knowledge in literary and epistemological traditions are
considered through such questions as whether the radical skepticism of
the 1690s provoked the Salem Witchcraft Trials.  Taking on one of the
key methodological issues in early American studies, the course asks
whether a transatlantic culture of Enlightenment becomes more uniquely
American as one charts its transformation through eighteenth-century
revivals and revolutions.

Title: Literary and Cultural Theory: Writing Sound

Description: This interdisciplinary course examines authors who formally
experiment with the writing of sound.  To put a deep voice, a shout, or
a minor scale to words creates a host of critical and creative
conundrums for a writer; the reading of such arrangements makes parallel
challenges for the reader. Such work is too often taken up with a
despairing ethos: much is said to "go lost" in the transfer from sound
to page.  This course does not presume the demise of such runaway
matter, but considers it as thriving with philosophical possibility.
What does the impossibility of sound's capture make possible for
literature and criticism?

myths in Plato to novels both modern (Virginia Woolf's <u>Orlando</u>)

consider the genesis and circulation of intersex as a category. Do
sexually different bodies pose a challenge to the idea of sexual
difference? What might literary fantasies about intersex reveal about
the construction of normative gender?

human activities and their interactions with natural systems. Beginning
with underlying principles, we will consider the social, political,
economic, scientific and technical dimensions of four areas of
environmental concern: the atmosphere (atmospheric pollution, its
sources and prevention); climate (climate and climate variability;
models and public policy); toxics in the environment (pollutants,
remediation and solutions); and water resources (watersheds, land use,
climate effects, political issues).

Prerequisites: The course will satisfy the ENV core course requirement

circumstances--including changes due to climate change--and to allow
livestock to reduce their environmental impact. Case studies, and
discussions with experts, will be used to evaluate these plants and
animals created using biotechnology and advanced plant breeding
techniques. We will also discuss the case against bioengineered foods
and explore concerns over ethics, and adequate testing for their impact
on human health and on the environment.

Title: Financial Accounting

Description: A survey of the concepts and techniques that non-managers
use to hold the managers of organized human activity--chiefly
corporations--accountable for the resources entrusted to them. Alerts
students to the judgments and assumptions that regulators and managers
make in that process, even when the managers wish to report honestly.
Explores the methods that the managers of resources can (and often do)
use to lie about their actual performance. While this course aims to
make you a sophisticated user, not producer, of financial statements,
you must master some record keeping procedures and vocabulary in order
to be the boss, not the servant.

Title: The Troubadours and the Occitan Tradition: Permutations of Desire
and Knowledge

Description: A study of this poetry from its purportedly oral origins to
its enmeshment in forms of scholasticism. Troubadour songs about love,
courtliness, and poetic refinement fired the imagination of audiences
across Europe. Desire in lyric quickly becomes desire for desire, desire
for lyric, and desire for the knowledge that the lyric brings; it
eventually produces desire for the lyric itself as a form of knowledge.
Course includes reflections on manuscript culture and theories of
poetry, desire and knowledge (by Agamben, Zizek, and others). Students
will be able to learn Old Occitan and work on microfilms or facsimiles
of manuscripts. Taught in Eng

Title: The Literature of Enlightenment

Description: This course examines how, in the era of emerging 'sciences
of Man,' Enlightenment writers circumscribed notions of self and other,
raising questions of fraudulent subjects, the naturalization of identity
and difference, and the invention of privacy.  We consider such
questions as: In becoming an object of knowledge, can persons only be
known as objects, and no longer as subjects? How do the figures of
synecdoche, metalepsis and catachresis, articulate power relations by,
and on, the person who speaks?

Title: Romanticism: The Literary Revolution: Art, Politics,
Representation

Description: A look at the revolution in literature in the political
context of the struggle to establish popular sovereignty (1789-1848).
What links the crisis of representation in the political sphere to this
crisis in the arts? What disjoins them? Who gets represented? Is
romanticism liberal or reactionary? Can writing be democratic? Taking
liberty, equality, and fraternity as a guide, along with their
discontents, we set up a series of textual dialogues. Novels, theater,
and essays by Chateaubriand, Mme de Stael, Constant, Guizot, Hugo,
Stendhal, Balzac, Vigny, Sand, Michelet, and Baudelaire; some recent
criticism.

Title: 20th-Century French Poetry or Theater: Surrealism

Description: This course examines the development of surrealism from its
birth in Dada-infused Paris through its years of exile in New York to
its decline after the Second World War. Materials considered will
include literary and theoretical texts, visual works (including film),
and magazines.  The course will treat the topic at a variety of inter-
related levels, exploring surrealism as part of the broad historical
phenomenon of the avant-garde, examining its specific ways of
(re)conceiving literature and art, and investigating the epistemological
ramifications of surrealism's aesthetic, political, and moral positions.

Title: Current and Future Climate

Description: This course explores the causes and consequences of human-
induced climate change, and the range of potential policy responses.  By
studying the natural climate system and how it is influenced by human
perturbation, we will develop a quantitative understanding of how
climate is expected to change in the future as greenhouse gases
accumulate in the atmosphere.  The course also examines scientific
themes that should frame any public policy based on risk management,
including irreversibility, uncertainty, and surprise.  We will also
examine the ways in which people, governments and other institutions are
actually responding to climate change.

transport, and preservation of sediment in response to these processes
is studied in order to better read stories of Earth history in the
geologic record and to better understand processes involved in modern
and ancient environmental change.

Description: Earth's climate is inextricably intertwined with the
terrestrial biosphere. In this course, we will explore the key
mechanisms that link climate (e.g., cloudiness, rainfall, and
temperature) with the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., ecosystem
composition, structure, and functioning), and how these mechanisms are
altered by humans. We will review basic aspects of climate, surface
energy balances, and terrestrial plant ecology, and then investigate
feedbacks and forcings arising from biophysical properties of the land
surface, biogeographical properties of ecosystems, deforestation, fires,
increases in atmospheric CO2, and other factors.

Title: Topics in Prose Fiction: Kafka Love

Description: Kafka wrote late in life that  "one develops in one's own
way only after death, only once one is alone." How, then, did Kafka
develop, who, upon his death in 1924, had published but a fraction of
his writings and left a will that seemed to ask for the destruction of
the rest? We will study the emergence of an exemplary author and iconic
figure by considering the literary scene he entered in 1908, his
romantic and textual engagements in Prague and Berlin, the posthumous
struggles over the publication, interpretation, and editing of his
novels, short prose, diaries, correspondences, and the love his solitary
stance provokes to this day.

Title: Europe in the World: Monarchies, Nations and Empires from 1776 to

Description: This course offers a global history from an unusual
perspective: that of the nations and empires ruled by monarchs and
emperors (and sometimes empresses) across the years since the American
and French revolutions, which are often seen as the events which ushered
in the modern world of republicanism and democracy.  To be sure, many
thrones have crashed and crowns have passed away since then; but
monarchies are still with us today, from Japan to Britain, Swaziland to
Sweden.  This course will explore both the anti-monarchical trends that
have thrived since 1776 and 1789, but also the surprising extent of
royal resilience.

Description: South Africa's past and present were and are closely
intertwined with those of its neighbors, including Angola, Zimbabwe, and
Mozambique. South Africa's industrial expansion, for example, relied on
thousands of migrant laborers from its neighbors.  The course will
highlight a variety of themes, including the rise and fall of African
empires (Great Zimbabwe and the Zulu kingdom), the effects of European
colonization and the repression caused by the Apartheid system.  The
focus will also be on the dramatic 1994 transition of South Africa to a
multiracial democratic society led by Nelson Mandela.

methods of occupation, collaboration, and resistance during World War II
in Western and Eastern Europe.  The Holocaust of European Jewry and the
technology of terror will be discussed.  We  will try to ascertain how
elites and different social strata were affected by the impact of war
and  occupation.  Students will be asked to read historical studies as
well as personal narratives by eyewitnesses and participants.

Title: The Civilization of the Early Middle Ages

Description: This course will survey the "Dark Ages" from the end of the
Roman Empire to the end of the first millennium (ca. 400-1000 AD), often
seen as a time of cultural and political decline, recently even labelled
as the "end of civilization". The complex political and social landscape
of the Roman Empire, however, had more to offer than just to end. This
course will outline how early medieval people(s) in the successor states
of the Roman Empire used its resources to form new communities and will
suggest to understand the "Dark Ages" as a time of lively social and
cultural experimentation, that created the social and political
frameworks of Europe.

Title: The Hispanic World, 1400-1800

Description: Long before Victorian Britain became synonymous with world
empire, there was Spain. In the 16th century, the kingdoms of medieval
Iberia banded together to forge the first global monarchy, reaching from
Latin America to the Philippines--only to watch it disintegrate in the
17th and 18th centuries. Understanding Spain's Golden Age is essential
for interpreting not only the histories of modern Spain and Latin
America, but also the history of the early modern world. Topics include
the creation of Spanish identity; Christian, Muslim, and Jewish
relations; the Renaissance; the governance of Empire; imperial decline;
and the Enlightenment.

Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites, though a basic familiarity
with European and/or Latin American history may prove useful. Students
prepared to read Spanish or Portuguese may choose to use foreign
language materials in their assignments, but this is not required.

history of medicine from Ancient times to the present. We will explore
ideas of health and disease in Antiquity, the rise of anatomy and
dissection in the Renaissance, the fight against germs in the nineteenth
century, and modern practices of health, life and death. Particular
attention is paid to the ways in which changing medical views and
practices were sustained by contemporary experience of the body. What
did it mean to fall ill and get better? How did people understand their
relationship to the environment? How could one prevent sickness by
living a healthy life?

Title: Technologies and Their Societies: Historical Perspectives

Description: This course offers a historical understanding of the role
of technology in U.S. history from the 1880s to the present.  It is
built on the idea that technology is simultaneously a reflection of
social and cultural values, and a factor (one of many) in the
transformation of those values.  Technologies of mass production, mass
consumption, and information are emphasized.  The role of the engineer
in American society is another recurring theme.  From factory floors to
suburban kitchens, ingenious inventors to angry student demonstrators,
Model Ts to Macs, the subjects reflect the diversity of American
technologies and technological environments.

Title: Politics of Racial Violence in America

Description: Racial violence has been a crucial component of the
American landscape. In order to broaden our understanding of racial
violence in the United States, the readings will examine racial violence
against not only African Americans, but against Native Americans,
Mexican Americans, and Japanese Americans.  We will examine how racist
ideologies and violence have worked to keep different groups of people
socially, politically, or economically oppressed at a given historical
moment.  Highlighting major historical events and individual
experiences, the course explores racial violence from a variety of
perspectives.

Title: Selected Topics in 20th Century Latin America: The Latin American
Cold War

Description: Examines the Cold War in Latin America from both North and
South, drawing on the new historiography of the period.  In addition to
geopolitical crises, the course considers the lived experience of
debates and conflicts within Latin American countries, over such issues
as development and student politics.  The course thus on the one hand
conceives of the Cold War in its international terms, which allows for
an understanding of U.S.-Latin American relations more broadly.  On
another level, studying the Cold War enables us to access national
histories and private stories, particularly the effects of repression on
both nations and  individuals.

Prerequisites: Previous work in Latin American history or U.S. foreign
relations is recommended, but not required.

Title: Imagined Cities

Description: An undergraduate seminar about the urban experiences and
representations of the modern city as society. Beginning with the
premise that the "soft city" of ideas, myths, symbols, images, and
psychic expressions is as important as the "hard city" of bricks and
mortar, this course explores the experiences and imaginations of modern
cities in different historical contexts. Among the cities we will
examine are Manchester, London, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Algiers,
Bombay, and Hong Kong. The course will use a variety of materials, but
will  focus particularly on cinema to examine different imaginative
expressions of the urban experience.

Title: Maimonides from Medieval Egypt to Modernity

Description: This course will use the works of Moses Maimonides (ca.
1136-1204) as a case study in the history of knowledge. After reading
select passages in his Guide of the Perplexed and The Code of Law, we
will trace the reception of Maimonides and his work from the 12th
century to modern times. As we read him and his interpreters we will pay
attention to questions of transmission, sociology of knowledge, and the
reception of a text.  We will also explore the Maimonidean controversies
in the high Middle Ages, the printing and censorship of his Code in the
early modern period, and his impact on the Jewish Enlightenment and
modern Jewish thought.

Title: Women and Gender in Early Modern England

Description: In this seminar we will explore women's lives in early
modern England, ideas about gender and sex, and the interactions of
people and ideas. While we will cover exceptional women (queens,
witches, writers), we will focus on the ordinary women who made up the
majority of the population. Readings will be drawn largely from primary
texts, including letters, memoirs, testimony, ballads, ephemera, and
advice books.  By exploring how legal and religious institutions shaped
women's lives, we will gain insight into major issues (family, law,
poverty, consumption, crime, the social order, etc.) in early modern
English society as a whole.

social, cultural, intellectual, and political history. Our exploration
will proceed from two premises: first, that race and slavery were
central to the causes and consequences of the war; and second, that the
war and its legacies remain central to the trajectory of modern U. S.
history. Note that this is not a course in military history.

Title: Slavery in Colonial North America

Description: Though slavery was the central feature of colonial America,
historical discussions of slavery tend to skip this era, leaping ahead
to the antebellum plantations of the Deep South. This seminar will
instead explore the more than two centuries of slavery that preceded the
cotton boom. We will ask questions such as: What is slavery? How did the
Atlantic slave trade work? What kinds of slavery existed in the 17th-
and 18th-century American colonies? How did race affect the creation of
slavery? Using a combination of primary and secondary readings, we will
seek to understand the origins and evolution of slavery in early North
America.

involvement in the French Indochina War, the commitment of military
forces in defense of South Vietnam, the character of the anti-war
movement, the consequences of the Tet Offensive, and the impact of war
upon American  society.  Although the American experience receives

historians? Course focuses on recent work by historians experimenting
with new forms of writing and considers the boundaries between fact and
fiction, the use of first-person narratives, and the limits of
historical speculation. Course also examines how journalists, novelists,
and film-makers narrate the past to ask what literary lessons they might
offer academic historians. In a series of structured assignments,
students experiment with different ways of writing about the past.

modernity which underlies some of the key recent interventions in Middle
Eastern studies.   Extending the work of Foucault, Derrida, Heidegger
and Latour to the non-West, the course examines how moving beyond the
modern opens it up to new kinds of investigation.  Course traces the
heterogeneity that constituted, paradoxically, a totalizing language
which awarded the experiences of Western modernity a universal role
through a consideration of texts on technology, religion, the city,
democracy, and gender in such places as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt,
Palestine, Israel, and Lebanon.

crossroads of 20th century totalitarian projects initiated by Nazi
Germany and Bolshevik Russia.  Endowed with liberal constitutions as a
result of the Versailles Treaty, states in the region experienced a full
spectrum of political regimes. Cultural and intellectual elites
experimented with a broad range of ideas and forms of expression. We
will study this variety of institutions and cultural artifacts using
narrative history, as well as literary essays, works of fiction, poetry,
and films produced by ECE.

Britain reached the apogee of its economic, financial and imperial
dominance.  But, from the 1870s onwards, while its empire's boundaries
continued to expand, its unchallenged global position was increasingly
eroded.  In the aftermath of two world wars, the empire dissolved in
only fifty years, and Britain itself was exposed to successive
"invasions."  After 1945, the empire came home, in that onetime colonial
peoples settled in Britain in unprecedented numbers; the country
reluctantly joined the EU, and it accepted both US bases and
increasingly Washington's lead in foreign policy.

literary, religious and cinematic sources, this course will explore the
history of Jerusalem from antiquity to the modern period. It will
examine its place in the religious imagination of Jews, Muslims and
Christians and trace the political history of a city that continues to
be one of the most inflammable places on earth. The course will look at
the conditions in today's 'united' Jerusalem and explore the different
contingencies to bring peace to it.

Title: Language and Information

Description: Intonation is used in a language like English for several
purposes.  Different intonation contours signal different sentence types
--questions, for example, have systematically different 'tunes' from
declarative statements, as do rebuttals, heges, and other speech-act
types.  In addition, the placement of the intonation nucleus signals
what is new and what is old information, as in the difference between
"JOHN died" and "John DIED".  The course will explore the principles of
phonology, syntax, semantics and discourse structure that constitute our
present understanding of such phenomena, both in English and across
different language types.

Title: Morphosyntax: Argument Expression, Grammatical Relations, and
Case

Description: Morphology (word structure) and syntax (sentence structure)
are typically treated as distinct disciplines. This course explores the
ways that morphology and syntax interact. We will look at recent
proposals and integrate morphology and syntax. Special attention is paid
to the proposal that the unification of morphology and syntax is based
on Argument Structure, which is part of each verb's entry in the
speaker's mental lexicon and is defined as the representation of the
relation between the verb and its arguments. A verb's arguments are
realized in syntactic structure as subject, direct object, and oblique
object.

Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites, but students with some
background in linguistics and knowledge of a language other than English
will have an easier time.

Title: Cognitive Linguistics

Description: Cognitive Linguistics is a broad approach to language that
places psychological reality at the top of the list of theoretical
desiderata. In this course we will investigate the nature of linguistic
semantic categories and the implications for theories of grammar.  In
the domain of semantic categories, we will study the issues and
controversies surrounding frame semantics, decompositional semantics,
conceptual metaphor, and exemplar/prototype/connectionist models.
Turning our attention to grammar, we will focus on both regularities and
irregularities, within and across languages, attempting to explain why
languages are the way they are.

Title: Advanced Multivariable Calculus

Description: This course is an introduction to multivariable calculus
and its applications.  Its goal is to cover the fundamental results of
Vector Calculus known as Green's, Stokes' and Gauss' theorems, and to
show how to use them to solve problems.  We attempt to explain the
theory behind the techniques so that "WHY" they work is understood.  The
level of rigor is midway between MAT 201 and 217.  The course is
designed for science and engineering students with a good mathematical
aptitude and for mathematicians with applied math interests.

Title: Analysis IV: Special Topics in Analysis

Description: Math 433 will cover methods of proving that certain numbers
are transcendental.  The tentative plan is to work through Siegel's
"Transcendental Numbers."  This is a famous work, in which Siegel proves
that various numbers are transcendental, starting with the nineteenth
century results that pi and e are transcendental, and then going on to
various generalizations, including some remarkable results that he
obtained.  This book is based on lectures that Siegel gave in 1946 and
is not up-to-date, but it is very clearly written and contains plenty of
material, which can still serve as a solid introduction to the subject.

Theorem on the relation of cohomological triviality and projectivity for
modules, using Tate cohomology.  We then apply these results to
construction of examples with many intersting and unusual properties,
particularly for actions on products of spheres.  Later, we consider the
problem of the free p-rank of symmetry of products of spheres, and try
to extend Carlsson's theorem to some new cases.

Title: Ends and Means: Issues in Composition

Description: Theater dynamics for the composer and musician. In this
seminar we will build short theater/music events through guided
improvisation.  These will serve as the basis for discussion and
analysis of various abstract issues like theatrical space and time
(theatrical momentum/rhythm as opposed to strictly musical
momentum/rhythm), the poetic and the narrative, spontaneity and
technique, and practical issues like collaboration, sources of sound and
music and their implicit and explicit meanings (the god speaker, the
'located' speaker, live sound), in short, a great many of the problems
theatrical elements present the musician and composer.

Title: Christianity along the Silk Road

Description: Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic very similar to the language
spoken by Jesus in first-century Palestine.  Aramaic-speaking Christians
in the Near East soon adopted Syriac as their literary language; by the
early fourteenth century, Syriac Christianity spread from the western
Mediterranean to China.  In this seminar we shall be exploring the
origins of Syriac Christianity in the Near East and its spread along the
Silk Road before 1500.

Title: The Making of the Ottoman Balkans, 1350-1500: Conquest,
Settlement and Infrastructural Development

Description: The Ottoman Empire is traditionally viewed through a
paradigm which stresses its Islamic character.  In keeping with this
assessment, its advances into southeastern Europe from the mid-14th
century onward are usually portrayed as stemming from a desire to expand
the frontiers of the Islamic East at the expense of the Christian West.
This course will present an alternative explanation, one focusing on the
extent to which the early Ottomans absorbed the peoples, practices, and
nobilities of the pre-existing Christian peoples of the Balkans.

Title: Clash of Civilizations? Perceptions of East and West from
Medieval Period to the Contemporary World

Description: Among the most pressing issues of our time is the perceived
divide between the Islamic "East" and the European and American "West."
As this course explores, the meeting of Islamicate and western
civilizations has a long, complicated history.  We shall examine the
roots of this tension and  the ways in which the two perceived one
another from the Middle Ages to modernity through classic works of
literature and art.  Likewise, we shall examine the experience of
"eastern" Judaism and Christianity, including how they viewed their
western counterparts, and the complex relationship between religion and
culture in the formation of identity.

Description: This course examines the political and social
transformation of the eastern Mediterranean from Istanbul to Alexandria
during the transition from the Ottoman Empire to contemporary nation-
states.  Its first major concern is with the relationships between

Description: Empirical Process theory mainly extends the law of large
numbers (LLN), central limit theorem (CLT) and exponential inequalities
to uniform LLN's and CLT's and concentration inequalities.  This
uniformaty is useful to statisticians and computer scientists in that
they often model data as a sample from some unknown distribution and
desire to estimate certain aspects of the population.  Uniform LLN or
CLT and concentration inequalities will imply that certain sample
averages will be uniformly close to their expectations regardless of the
unknown distributions. This class intends to review modern empirical
process theory and its related asymptot

Title: Introduction to Moral Philosophy

Description: Can questions about what is right or wrong have real
answers independent of any sort of divine authority? Are there moral
principles that any rational person must recognize, or is morality
essentially an expression of our feelings or a product of our culture?
Are we morally required to do our part in making the world as good as it
can be, or does morality give us permission to pursue our own peculiar
enthusiasms and interests? What should we do about deception, unwanted
pregnancies, and world hunger?  This course will provide an overview of
these and other issues in moral philosophy.

Title: Political Philosophy

Description: Many people think they can recognize democracy when they
see it and that democracy is uncontroversially good. Even if they are
right, it is worth trying to give a theoretical account of what makes a
practice, institution or state democratic; and to consider and evaluate
arguments for and against democracy. So we will begin with a brisk
survey of some traditional analyses and defenses of democracy and we
will then spend the rest of our time (a) discussing a few more recent
attempts to say what the core elements of democracy are and to defend
it, and (b) evaluating some recent challenges to democratic ideals.

principle change the past? What makes a certain object at one time
identical with a certain object at a later time? Are human beings truly
free, or are their actions determined by factors beyond their control?
Or both? Why does the world exist?

cultural relativism about beliefs concerning matters of fact; conceptual
relativism, deriving from claims about the existence of distinct and,
perhaps, incompatible conceptual schemes; something called "epistemic
relativism"; and moral relativism of various kinds. We will look for the
common structure of the various relativisms--if there is one--and
explore whether relativism in any of these domains is plausible.

Title: Radical Political Thought

Description: This course will examine traditions of political thought--
mostly, but not only, on the Left--which challenge mainstream
conceptions of liberal democracy and modern capitalist society.  The
main focus will be on Marxism, anarchism, feminism, religious
radicalism, ecological thought, and critiques of alienation in everyday
life.  Particular attention is paid to the relationship between
political and cultural criticism, and to the philosophical
anthropologies underlying different theories as well as the mechanisms
for social change they envisage.  We also ask if liberal democratic
thought can effectively respond to radical challenges.

Title: Democratic Theory

Description: This course will introduce students to the principal
historical figures in thinking about democracy: Aristotle, Hobbes,
Rousseau, Mill, Schumpeter and others. But the rationale of the course
is philosophical rather than historical. Let democracy require that
government be of the people, by the people and for the people: that the
people be the ultimate governing authority, that they be the agents by
whom  government is conducted, and that they be the beneficiaries in
whose interest government is exercised. The aim of the course will be to
see whether there is a plausible and appealing sense in which those
conditions can be fulfilled.

Title: Political Psychology

Description: This course explores the psychological foundations of
political life. We begin by considering different analytic frameworks
for understanding human nature, examining the contributions of
economics, sociology, and psychology to explanations of political
behavior. We then apply these theories and concepts to investigating a
range of political and public policy issues, including: how people
develop their political attitudes; how mass media and campaigns shape
public opinion; the root causes of racism and prejudice; why people
vote, volunteer and engage in protest; and the psychological
underpinnings of extremism, suicide terrorism, and genocide.

Title: Comparative Political Economy

Description: The focus of this course will be on the origins and
economic impact of political institutions (e.g. Democracy vs. Autocracy,
different types of Democracy). We shall argue that these are not
"neutral", as different institutions allocate political power
differently among social groups with conflicting goals, who then have
naturally different preferences on them. Special attention shall be paid
to the influence of international relations (and particularly
international conflicts) on domestic institutions and policy outcomes.
Occasionally, we will also make use of some simple formal models of
political economy.

essential to evaluate controversies in national security and civil
liberties in a democracy. We examine tensions through history, statute,
technology, public opinion, the media and current events. Can we
implement effective security and not adversely impact our constitutional
rights? What is the "correct" relationship between intelligence and law
enforcement? Should information be shared and/or protected? Technology
threatens or protects? Is post 9/11 reform on track? You decide if
government is making the right choices "for the country and individuals"
based on this critical material.

Title: Seminar in Political Theory: Executive Power

Description: This seminar examines an important conundrum associated
with the theory of executive power. Political theorists have long
recognized that as the laws cannot foresee every contingency, men and
women must rule when necessity demands. However, entrusting men and
women with such discretionary power is problematic because they might
abuse it. We will study how prominent theorists of executive power,
including Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke and Publius have attempted to solve
this conundrum. Drawing on secondary literature as well as documentaries
and news reports, we will also analyze the feasibility of their
solutions in the modern world.

human nature? Who is the human being? What are the differences and
overlaps between contemporary secular and theological accounts of human
nature? What are the differences and overlaps between Jewish and
Christian theology?

Title: Inequality: Class, Race, and Gender

Description: Using an intersectional approach to the study of
inequality, this course will examine race, class and gender as
interrelated systems of power that create differences in opportunities
and resources for groups and individuals in U.S. society. We will study
the meanings and histories of these and other dimensions of social
differentiation to explore patterns that result in disparate outcomes in
such areas as education, health, work, family, and poverty. Unveiling
contemporary disparities and rethinking the seemingly familiar will lead
to considerations of the relationship between inequality, social policy
and social justice.

Title: Sociological Theory

Description: The classical theorists of the 19th and 20th century laid a
foundation for Sociology.  This course introduces students to the
political history that surrounded European scholars--Marx, Weber, and
Durkheim--and their American "descendants"--WEB DuBois, the "Chicago
School" scholars of urbanism, and the symbolic interactionists.  We ask
what it was about urban life that convinced them society was in danger
of complete fragmentation, and how these challenges informed their key
ideas about the nature of the social order itself.  In precepts,
students will learn about how the classical theorists influenced social
theory in our own time.

Title: God of Many Faces: Comparative Perspectives on Migration and

Description: Immigrants often experience discrimination in areas of
destination. Religion can strengthen their sense of worth, particularly
when the circumstances surrounding departure from the country of origin
are traumatic, as with exiles and refugees. We take a comparative
approach and use examples from the United States, Asia, Europe, and
Latin America. The course broaches questions such as: how does religion
transform and is transformed by the immigrant experience? When is
religion used to combat stereotypes? Are there differences between the
way men and women or dominant groups and racial minorities understand
religion?

Title: Queer Theory and Politics

Description: We assume people are either "gay" or "straight." What
happens when these categories are thrown out the window? "Queer theory"
provides an answer that suggests all identity categories are unstable,
fluid, multiple, and dynamic. The goal of this course is (1) to use
interdisciplinary perspectives to challenge assumptions about the study
of sexuality, identity, and politics and (2) to consider the
relationship between identity, inequality, and social justice. Course
topics will include the history of sexuality, sexuality as a mode of
self-understanding, and political organizing that uses identity as the
beginning point for activism.

Title: Topics in the Intellectual History of Modern and Contemporary
Spain: Culture and Memory of the Spanish Civil War

Description: An examination of the narrative, poetry, film, songs,
photography and graphic art generated by Spaniards and foreigners about
the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in the seventy years since the war was
fought. This cultural production will be examined in the context of the
political and ideological reasons that explain the international
attraction the war generated. Among the works examined: poems by Neruda;
Picasso's Guernica (it was the first war in which aviation played a
significant role); documentaries (The Spanish Earth, Mourir a Madrid);
and photographs by Robert Capa (the Spanish Civil War consecrated the
nascent art of photojournalism).

Title: Topics in Latin American Cultural Studies: Profane Realisms -
Latin American Cinema & Literature

Description: If "magical realism" was a familiar trademark of Latin
American literary and filmic exports in the 1960s and 1970s, this course
studies a counter-movement which sprang up in the 1990s. Rather than the
narratives of exile and mourning that predominated after the military
dictatorships, the new texts and films are "political" only insofar as
they deal with the intimate effects of political processes. Focusing on
the Southern Cone, the course explores the ways in which the very status
of literature and film, and their take on "the real," has fundamentally
changed over the last quarter-century.

Title: Topics in the Politics of Writing and Difference: Cuban
Literature of Slavery

Description: A course on the relationship between Cuban literature and
slavery. Explicitly "Cuban" literature emerged from the literary salon
of Domingo del Monte, a 19th century reformist with ties to British
abolitionism, and early works focused on the island's massive slave
industry.  We will read several anti-slavery novels, emphasizing ties to
transatlantic Romanticism and sentimental literature, and generic
conventions more generally.  Also: the only known Spanish-language slave
autobiography; an oral history from an ex-slave; the diary of a bounty-
hunter; psychoanalysis, and modern Cuban representations of slavery,
including films.

Prerequisites: One 200-level SPA course on literature or culture or
instructor's permission.

Title: Seminar in Modern Spanish-American Literature: Modernity and the
Landscape

Description: The landscape idea in Latin American architecture, visual
and verbal arts, is an immediately political, social and historical one.
There is a history of Latin American landscapes, including the landscape
of modernism, of development, of revolution, and of (post)dictatorship.
The purpose of the seminar is to bring out this historicity of the
landscape-form, both in its material manifestations and its
representations. Following a theoretical overview of some of the main
concepts, we will work through a series of concrete examples from Latin
American architecture, visual arts (including film) and literature.

Title: Special Topics in Performance Practice: Devised Theater

Description: Devised Theater is a form of contemporary theater-making in
which, more often than not, the final theatrical product originates not
from a rehearsal process during which a director and a group of actors
spend weeks interpreting an already-written script provided by a
playwright, but instead from a collaborative, usually improvisatory,
process involving a large collective of theater practitioners, not all
of them performers. Among our subjects, largely American: The Civilians,
who will be in residence doing a Princeton Atelier in conjunction with
the Princeton Environmental Institute; the Pig Iron Theatre; the
Tectonic Theatre Project.

Title: Special Topics in Performance History and Theory: Performance and
Politics in the 1960s

Description: This course will explore performance of the 1960s American
theater--Broadway, the avant-garde, political theaters--in the context
of the social, cultural, and intellectual politics of the decade. We'll
consider production practices and intentions, "texts" (both scripted and
unscripted), and reception, both critical and popular. Our goal will be
to construct a complex and nuanced "thick description" of performance
and politics during this volatile period, while also questioning the
value and limitations of decade-oriented historiography.

Title: Advanced Studies in Acting: Scene Study and Style

Description: This workshop will use mask work to train students to find
the "Neutral State," to tweak that state toward character work and
eventually toward the idiosyncratic and personal world of the Clown.
Neutral Mask trains actors to find an elusive yet simple physical state
rid of background noise in order to engage the theater at its roots:
physical, spatial, rhythmic, dynamic and expressive. We'll then explore
some of the infinite possibilities of creating masked comic characters,
based on variations from neutrality. The final step will be the
discovery of the Clown, through the use of the smallest mask in the
world - the red nose.

Title: Translating East Asia

Description: Translation is at the core of our engagement with China,

understanding of East Asia. From translations of the classics to the
grass-root subtitling of contemporary Anime movies, from the formation
of the modern East Asian cultural discourse to cross-cultural references
in theater and film, the seminar poses fundamental questions to our
encounters with East Asian cultural artifacts, reflecting on what
"translation" of "original works" means in a global world where the
"original" is often already located in its projected "translation."

Title: Special Topics in Public Affairs: Urban Revitalization

Description: This course will focus on the dynamics of urban
revitalization.  Beginning in the 1950s, many neighborhoods that were
home to the working class and a stepping stone to the middle class began
to decline economically and became densely concentrated with the urban
poor.  In recent years, many neighborhoods have been rejuvenated.  We
will examine the lifecycle of these communities, the forces behind their
decline, the policies and players that have spearheaded their revival,
the reasons some neighborhoods have yet to recover, and the policy
conflicts and community tensions that arise when gentrification gains a
foothold in the inner city.

Title: Special Topics in Public Affairs: Grand Strategy

Description: Military strategy was defined by Clausewitz as the use of
battle to achieve the objectives of war.  Grand strategy is broader,
encompassing the attempted use by political leaders of financial,
economic, and diplomatic, as well as military, power to achieve their
objectives in peacetime and in war.  This seminar will examine the
theory and practice of grand strategy both to illuminate how relations
among city-states, empires, kingdoms and nation states have evolved over
the centuries and also to identify some common challenges that have
confronted all who seek to make and execute grand strategy, from
Pericles to Barack Obama.

Prerequisites: Some knowledge of U.S. European, and/or Asian history is
essential, though there are no prerequisite courses.

Title: Special Topics in Public Affairs: The Economics of Health Policy
in Developing Countries

Description: Early death is arguably the worst manifestation of poverty
in developing countries. Much of this premature death, and the low
quality of life that goes with it, is avoidable with well conceived and
executed pubic policy.  But there's the rub.  Setting priorities for
what government (and well-meaning outsiders) should do with very limited
means requires hard choices--matters of life and death. The choices are
limited both by the severe resource constraints in poor countries and
constraints of effective implementation of programs.  This course
focuses on how economic reasoning can help inform effective policy.

Title: Special Topics in Public Affairs: Israeli Extremism and the
Search for Peace

Description: In 1995 Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was
assassinated at a peace rally by a religious student. Rabin's
assassination helped derail the peace process; it also exposed deep
currents of political extremism in Israel. This course explores the
roots of Israeli political radicalism. It examines the impact of the
Arab-Jewish conflict on Israeli politics and assesses the way the '67
War impacted political alignments in Israel. The course considers how
political radicalism in Israel reacted to the peace efforts of the '90s
and it looks at how in the 21st century, with the rise of fundamentalism
globally, political radicalism impacts Israel.

Title: Pulp Fictions: Jacobean Tragedy and American Film Noir

Description: This course juxtaposes two genres distant in time from one
another but sharing a dark and violent imaginative space: Jacobean
tragedy and classic American film noir. Looking at plays staged in the
first decades of the seventeenth century and movies produced between
1944 and 1955, we'll focus on the alienated heroes, witty murderers,
femme fatales and other sexual outlaws they have in common, as well as
their shared melancholia, louche locales, and moral ambiguities.

Title: Advanced Studies in Acting: Scene Study and Style

Description: This workshop will use mask work to train students to find
the "Neutral State," to tweak that state toward character work and
eventually toward the idiosyncratic and personal world of the Clown.
Neutral Mask trains actors to find an elusive yet simple physical state
rid of background noise in order to engage the theater at its roots:
physical, spatial, rhythmic, dynamic and expressive. We'll then explore
some of the infinite possibilities of creating masked comic characters,
based on variations from neutrality. The final step will be the
discovery of the Clown, through the use of the smallest mask in the
world - the red nose.

Prerequisites: THR 201 or THR 301 or THR 311 OR any class in Dance.
<b>APPLICATION INFORMATION:</b> Please see the Program website for
specific application information. THR 401 can be taken up to three
times, with the permission of the Program Director, as long as the
instructor or the subject matter is different.

Title: Re:Staging the Greeks

Description: Re:Staging the Greeks, a collaboration between the Theater
Program of the Lewis Center for the Arts and the Program in Hellenic
Studies, will begin with this acting/directing workshop investigating
how to stage ancient Greek plays on the contemporary stage. On Tuesdays,
we will study some of the plays, the contexts in which they were first
performed, and approaches taken by theater directors over the last few
decades.  On Fridays, we'll be on our feet, exploring the play's
performative possibilities for ourselves.

Prerequisites: THR 201, 205, 301, 311, or 317 OR significant theatrical
experience. By application and audition. Students interested in
auditioning for THR 365 should contact professor Tim Vasen directly.

Title: Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)

Description: In the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)
program, students earn academic credit for their participation in
multidisciplinary design teams that solve technology-based problems for
local not-for-profit organizations. The teams are: multidisciplinary--
drawing students from across engineering and around the university;
vertically-integrated--maintaining a mix of sophomores through seniors
each semester; and long-term--each student may participate in a project
for up to six semesters. The continuity, technical depth, and
disciplinary breadth of these teams enable delivery of projects of
significant benefit to the community.
